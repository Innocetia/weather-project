This repository contains a weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a SheCodes workshop. The app allows users to check the weather for different cities using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes features like dynamic date and time display, temperature conversion (Celsius) and a clean, responsive layout. This project gave me hands-on experience with JavaScript functions and API integration in real time â€” helping me build confidence in frontend development and deepen my understanding of how to create interactive web apps from scratch.
